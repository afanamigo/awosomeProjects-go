package main

import "fmt"

// go project is based on package(folder), save as java but grace and much more easy
// running with cli: go run filename.go or go build, then run the executable file.
// in this case is, go run hello.go, Or go build HelloMain.go, ./Hello

// copy from Hello.go, package main not means under main Folder.
// main is the program source code package, entry point of the executable application.
func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello World, Hello Golang!")
